📌 About the Project : 
This Movie Recommender System is built using Machine Learning and deployed using Streamlit.


The system helps users discover movies similar to their favorite ones using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) approach based on similarity scores.


🚀 Features :
🔍 Search for any movie from the available database

🤖 Get top 5 similar movies based on content similarity

🖼️ Displays movie posters using TMDB API

📊 Built using KNN algorithm with cosine similarity

🌐 Deployed using Streamlit Cloud🛠️ Tech Stack


💡 How It Works :

1.User selects or searches for a movie.

2.The system looks up precomputed cosine similarity scores from similarity.pkl.

3.Top 5 most similar movies are fetched.

4.Their posters are retrieved using the TMDB API.

5.Recommendations are displayed on the Streamlit UI.
